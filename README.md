# Description

The Banking Application Project includes the development of a comprehensive banking system, tailored to accommodate both customers and administrators. This project, leveraging the Spring Boot framework for backend operations and React for the frontend, will provide users with a streamlined management tool to effectively oversee their accounts. The primary objective of this banking system is to deliver a robust platform that meets the diverse needs of both users and administrators while prioritizing security and efficiency

## Technical Requirements
- Build the application at least Java 17 and Spring Boot 3

- All interactions between a User and the API should happen via HTTP Requests. Including a tool like Postman is usefull to test the API and the HTTP resquests

- All data should be stored in PostgreSQL Database to persistance our data

Technology framework requirements: 
- Java API will leverage the Spring Framework 
- Java API will use Spring Data JPA to communicate with the DB
- Java API will be RESTful (though HttpSession will be permitted)
- The user interface will be built using React, Angular, CSS
- Bootstrap can be used for styling instead of CSS
- Hibernate will be the mapping tool between the object-oriented domain model and the relational database

 
Stretch goals (not limited to):
- Secure your Java API endpoints using JWTs
- Dark mode

- **NOTE** Responses from the API must include proper response bodies (in JSON) and **status codes**
